  "en-US": "&lt;p&gt;Organization management is based on decisions made by managers and those who work with them. Organizations are made up of managers and groups of workers whom they lead through decision-making. It was previously noted that one of the key roles of a manager is decision-making roles. Decision-making, along with the presence of subordinates, is the hallmark of the manager&amp;#39;s position in the organization.&lt;br&gt;Decision-making is an important part of any management activity. If communication is a kind of core that permeates any activity in the organization, then decision-making is the center around which the life of the organization revolves. A decision is viewed as a product of management activity, and its adoption is viewed as a process leading to the emergence of this product.&lt;/p&gt;"
